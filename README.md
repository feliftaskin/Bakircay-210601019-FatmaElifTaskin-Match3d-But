🎮 Bakırçay Fall-2024 Game Development Project: Resit exam Submission
This is a 3D matching game I developed as part of my coursework at Bakırçay University during the Fall 2024 semester. My goal with this project was to enhance my game development skills using Unity and to gain practical experience with 3D object interactions, animations, and mechanics.

🛠️ Resit exam Features
Core Mechanics
Game Area Setup

The game area spawns a specified number of 3D object pairs (minimum 6 pairs -> 12 objects).
Objects are randomly placed and confined within the game boundaries.
Drag-and-Drop Interaction

Players can select objects and drag them into a placement area.
Objects follow the cursor smoothly and remain slightly above it to enhance precision.
Once placed, objects are fixed in position and no longer affected by physics.
Matching Mechanics

If two matching objects are placed in the area, they disappear with an animation, and the score increases.
Incorrect objects are ejected back into the game area.
New objects spawn when all objects are matched.

Added Skills
Skill 1: Explosion Skill
Temporarily disables all objects in the game area for 5 seconds. The objects in the scene are filtered and temporarily removed with an explosion

Skill 2: Freeze Skill
Freezes all objects in their current positions for 5 seconds.

Skill 3: Hint Skill
Highlights two matchable objects for a limited time.

Skill 4: Auto Match
Automatically finds and matches two identical objects on the game board, removing them with an animation and increasing the player's score.

🕹️ Gameplay Overview
Players start with randomly placed objects in the game area and must drag them into the placement zone to match pairs.

How to Play:
Drag & Drop: Select any object and move it to the placement area.
Match: Place the pair of an object already in the placement area to make both disappear and score points.
Use Skills: Activate the four unique skills to gain strategic advantages during gameplay.
